Additionally, this page will hold all information regarding to my journey both as a developer and as an athlete.

## ChallengePage.jsx

The `ChallengePage.jsx` will contain two scrollable divisions, one pertaining to physical training, while the other will hold information regarding mental growth. The goal of this page is that it will hold a randomly generated workout and a randomly generated mental exercise to prompt users to easily identify an opportunity to grow and log an outstanding entry into their journals.

## UserAuthPage.jsx

The `UserAuthPage.jsx` will be a single page that will alternate between form components to either log in a user with the proper credentials, or register a user to generate a new token for said user.

## MyWorkOuts.jsx

The `MyWorkOuts.jsx` page will contain the same format as the challenge page with the exception that users will be able to conduct CRUD capabilities with the Work outs they have or are planning to have as an entry within their diaries.
